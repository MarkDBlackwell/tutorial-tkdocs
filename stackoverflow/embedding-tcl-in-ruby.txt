> Embedding tcl in ruby[.] Is there any way to do this?

I came across
[this post](http://www.thecodingforums.com/threads/run-tcl-in-ruby.818976/#post-4454838)
by
[Matz](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=887170269&title=Yukihiro_Matsumoto)
himself in 2005, from a thread called, "Run TCL in ruby".

His example program (from the post) evaluates strings of Tcl code from Ruby without shelling out:
```ruby
```
Its console output is:
```
".lab"
""
print by ruby
puts by tcl/tk
""
```
Quoting from his post:

> The tcltklib extension, which comes with the standard distribution, invokes Tcl interpreter directly without any inter-process communication.

To make it work, I needed to duplicate the following directories:

1. `/c/Ruby/lib/tcltk/tcl8.5` as `/c/Ruby/lib/tcl8.5`
1. `/c/Ruby/lib/tcltk/tk8.5` as `/c/Ruby/lib/tk8.5`

(Possibly, your Ruby is installed somewhere else.)

In a reply post immediately below Matz's, Hidetoshi Nagai says:

> If no need for Tk, an IP without Tk can be created. To do that, please call `TclTkIp.new(nil, false)`.

So here is Matz's program, altered to run without a Tk graphics window:
```ruby
```
Its console output is:
```
"{ aa bb cc }"
"aabbcc"
```
These two programs worked for me, using Ruby 2.2.5 (with Tk 8.5.12) on Windows 7.

For what it's worth, here is the
[manual](http://github.com/ruby/tk/blob/master/MANUAL_tcltklib.eng)
for `tcltklib`.
